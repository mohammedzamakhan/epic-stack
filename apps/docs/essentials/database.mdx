# Database

Epic Stack uses Prisma as its ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool with SQLite as the default database.

## Prisma ORM

Prisma provides:

- Type-safe database access
- Automatic migrations
- Schema definition through the Prisma schema
- Powerful query capabilities

## Schema Structure

The default schema includes models for:

- Users
- Authentication (passwords, sessions)
- Notes (sample application)
- Permissions and roles
- Connections (for OAuth providers)
- Passkeys (WebAuthn)

## Migrations

Database migrations are handled through Prisma:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev    # Create a migration in development
npm run db:migrate:deploy # Apply migrations in production
```

## Connection Pooling

In production, Epic Stack is configured with connection pooling for better performance and reliability.

## Data Access

Data access is provided through a centralized Prisma client:

```typescript
import { prisma } from '@repo/prisma'

// Query example
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId },
  include: { notes: true }
})
```
