# Linear Integration Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Linear integration provider for the Epic Stack integrations system.

## Overview

The Linear integration allows users to connect their notes to Linear teams and projects, automatically creating issues when notes are created, updated, or deleted. Linear is a modern project management and issue tracking tool that uses GraphQL for its API.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure authentication using Linear's OAuth 2.0 flow
- **Team Integration**: Connect notes to Linear teams for issue creation
- **Project Integration**: Connect notes to Linear projects for organized issue tracking
- **Issue Creation**: Automatically create Linear issues from note changes
- **Connection Validation**: Verify that connections are still active and accessible

### Supported Operations
- List available teams and projects
- Create issues in teams or projects
- Format issue titles and descriptions with note content
- Validate connection status

## Authentication

### OAuth 2.0 Flow
Linear uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication with the following configuration:

- **Authorization URL**: `https://linear.app/oauth/authorize`
- **Token URL**: `https://linear.app/oauth/token`
- **Scopes**: `read,write` (read access to Linear data, write access to create issues)

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your_linear_client_id
LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linear_client_secret
```

### OAuth Configuration
1. Create a Linear OAuth application at https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Set the redirect URI to your application's OAuth callback endpoint
3. Configure the required scopes: `read,write`

## API Integration

### GraphQL API
Linear uses a GraphQL API at `https://api.linear.app/graphql`. All requests require:
- **Authorization**: `Bearer {access_token}`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### Key GraphQL Queries

#### Get Current User
```graphql
query {
  viewer {
    id
    name
    displayName
    email
    avatarUrl
  }
}
```

#### Get Teams
```graphql
query {
  teams {
    nodes {
      id
      name
      key
      description
      color
      icon
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get Projects
```graphql
query {
  projects {
    nodes {
      id
      name
      description
      color
      state
      teams {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          key
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create Issue
```graphql
mutation($input: IssueCreateInput!) {
  issueCreate(input: $input) {
    success
    issue {
      id
      identifier
      title
      description
      url
      state {
        name
        color
      }
      team {
        id
        name
        key
      }
      project {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Provider Configuration (LinearConfig)
```typescript
interface LinearConfig {
  userId: string        // Linear user ID
  userName: string      // Linear user display name
  userEmail: string     // Linear user email
  scope: string         // OAuth scope granted
}
```

### Connection Configuration (LinearConnectionConfig)
```typescript
interface LinearConnectionConfig {
  channelId: string           // Team or project ID (prefixed with 'team:' or 'project:')
  channelName: string         // Display name of the team or project
  channelType: 'team' | 'project'  // Type of Linear entity
  includeNoteContent: boolean // Whether to include full note content in issues
  defaultIssueState?: string  // Default state for created issues
  issuePriority?: string      // Priority level for created issues
}
```

## Data Models

### Channel Representation
Teams and projects are represented as channels for consistency with other providers:

- **Team Channels**: `team:{teamId}` - Direct team integration
- **Project Channels**: `project:{projectId}` - Project-specific integration

### Issue Creation
When a note is connected to Linear, issues are created with:
- **Title**: Formatted with emoji prefix based on change type (üìù created, ‚úèÔ∏è updated, üóëÔ∏è deleted)
- **Description**: Includes note URL, author, action type, and optionally the full note content
- **Team Assignment**: Issues are assigned to the connected team
- **Project Assignment**: For project connections, issues are assigned to both the project and its primary team

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid OAuth Token**: Token expired or revoked
2. **Insufficient Permissions**: User lacks access to team/project
3. **GraphQL Errors**: API-level errors from Linear
4. **Network Issues**: Connection problems with Linear API

### Error Recovery
- Token validation before API calls
- Graceful degradation when connections are invalid
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Connection status validation

## Security Considerations

### Token Management
- Access tokens are stored encrypted in the database
- Tokens are validated before use
- No refresh token support (Linear tokens are long-lived, typically 1 year)

### Data Privacy
- Only necessary user information is stored
- Issue content respects user privacy settings
- Connection configurations are stored securely

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Team Connection
```typescript
// User selects a team during connection setup
const teamChannel = {
  id: 'team:abc123',
  name: 'Engineering Team',
  type: 'public',
  metadata: {
    type: 'team',
    teamId: 'abc123',
    teamKey: 'ENG',
    color: '#3b82f6'
  }
}
```

### Creating a Project Connection
```typescript
// User selects a project during connection setup
const projectChannel = {
  id: 'project:def456',
  name: 'Mobile App Project - Engineering',
  type: 'public',
  metadata: {
    type: 'project',
    projectId: 'def456',
    state: 'active',
    teams: [{ id: 'abc123', name: 'Engineering', key: 'ENG' }]
  }
}
```

### Issue Creation from Note
When a note titled "Fix login bug" is created by "John Doe":

```markdown
üìù Fix login bug

**Note:** [Fix login bug](https://app.example.com/notes/123)
**Author:** John Doe
**Action:** Created

**Content:**
The login form is not validating email addresses correctly. Users can submit invalid emails and the system accepts them.
```

## Implementation Notes

### GraphQL Integration
- All API calls use GraphQL for consistency with Linear's API design
- Proper error handling for GraphQL-specific error formats
- Efficient queries to minimize API calls

### Channel Mapping
- Teams and projects are both represented as "channels" for UI consistency
- Channel IDs are prefixed to distinguish between teams and projects
- Metadata includes type-specific information for proper handling

### Token Limitations
- Linear doesn't support refresh tokens
- Access tokens are long-lived (typically 1 year)
- Re-authentication required when tokens expire

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- OAuth flow validation
- GraphQL query construction
- Error handling scenarios
- Channel mapping logic

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end OAuth flow
- Issue creation in teams and projects
- Connection validation
- Error recovery scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
