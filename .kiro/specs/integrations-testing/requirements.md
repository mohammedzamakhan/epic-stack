# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `@repo/integrations` package provides a comprehensive third-party service integration framework for the monorepo, including OAuth management, token encryption, provider implementations, and event-driven notification systems. To ensure the reliability and correctness of this critical package, we need to implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the core components of the integrations package, so that I can ensure they work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing tests for the OAuth flow management THEN the test suite SHALL verify state generation, validation, and token refresh functionality
2. WHEN implementing tests for token encryption THEN the test suite SHALL verify encryption and decryption of OAuth tokens
3. WHEN implementing tests for the provider registry THEN the test suite SHALL verify provider registration, retrieval, and type filtering
4. WHEN implementing tests for the integration service THEN the test suite SHALL verify OAuth flow initiation and callback handling
5. WHEN implementing tests for security utilities THEN the test suite SHALL verify rate limiting and webhook signature validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the Slack provider implementation, so that I can ensure it correctly integrates with the Slack API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the Slack OAuth flow THEN the tests SHALL verify correct authorization URL generation
2. WHEN testing the Slack callback handling THEN the tests SHALL verify token exchange and error handling
3. WHEN testing channel retrieval THEN the tests SHALL verify correct mapping of Slack channels
4. WHEN testing message posting THEN the tests SHALL verify correct formatting and API calls
5. WHEN testing token refresh THEN the tests SHALL verify correct handling of Slack's token refresh mechanism

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the Jira provider implementation, so that I can ensure it correctly integrates with the Jira API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the Jira OAuth flow THEN the tests SHALL verify correct authorization URL generation with required scopes
2. WHEN testing the Jira callback handling THEN the tests SHALL verify token exchange and error handling
3. WHEN testing project retrieval THEN the tests SHALL verify correct mapping of Jira projects to channels
4. WHEN testing issue creation THEN the tests SHALL verify correct formatting and API calls
5. WHEN testing token refresh THEN the tests SHALL verify correct handling of Jira's token refresh mechanism

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that verify the end-to-end functionality of the integrations package, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the complete OAuth flow THEN the tests SHALL verify the entire process from authorization to token storage
2. WHEN testing provider interactions THEN the tests SHALL verify correct API calls with mock responses
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the tests SHALL verify proper error handling and recovery
4. WHEN testing token refresh flows THEN the tests SHALL verify automatic token refresh when needed
5. WHEN testing with the actual database repositories THEN the tests SHALL verify correct storage and retrieval of integration data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test mocks and fixtures for external API dependencies, so that tests can run reliably without actual API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing test mocks THEN the test suite SHALL include mock implementations of all external API endpoints
2. WHEN implementing test fixtures THEN the test suite SHALL include sample responses for all API calls
3. WHEN implementing mock providers THEN the test suite SHALL include a test provider implementation for verification
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the test suite SHALL include mock error responses for all API endpoints
5. WHEN running tests THEN no actual API calls SHALL be made to external services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage reports, so that I can identify areas of the code that need additional testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the test suite SHALL generate coverage reports for all code files
2. WHEN reviewing coverage reports THEN the reports SHALL show line, branch, and function coverage
3. WHEN implementing tests THEN the test suite SHALL aim for at least 80% coverage for all metrics
4. WHEN finding uncovered code THEN additional tests SHALL be implemented to increase coverage
5. WHEN running CI/CD pipelines THEN coverage reports SHALL be generated and stored as artifacts
